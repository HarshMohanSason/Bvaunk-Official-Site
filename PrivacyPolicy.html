    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy“) is published in accordance with the provisions of Rule 3(1) of the Information
        Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. The Policy is an ‘electronic record’ contemplated under
        section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the rules. This Policy, being an electronic record, is
        generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signature.</p>

    <h2>PRIVATE INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal
        information you give us, such as your name, address, and email address. When you browse our store, we also
        automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information
        that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. Email marketing (if applicable): With your
        permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products, and other updates.</p>
    <p>We at Bvaunk, in any case, do not sell your information. However, we use third-party services like payment
        gateways to ensure secure transactions.</p>

    <h2>YOUR CONSENT</h2>
    <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order,
        arrange a delivery, or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting and using it for that
        specific reason only.</p>

    <h2>DISCLOSURE</h2>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
        Service.</p>

    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>We use CC for processing payments. We do not store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through
        the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction
        data is only used as long as necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your
        purchase transaction information is not saved. Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
        managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American
        Express, and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure our store and its service providers’ secure handling of
        credit card information.</p>

    <h2>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the
        extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service
        providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies
        concerning the information we are required to provide them for your purchase-related transactions. For these
        providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand how they will handle your
        personal information. In particular, certain providers may be located in or have facilities in a different
        jurisdiction than you or us. So, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a
        third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in
        which that service provider or its facilities are located. Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected
        to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s
        Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information and follow industry best practices to ensure
        it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
